"""Put this directory and ``tools/`` on ``sys.path``.

This repo builds with colcon (``ament_cmake``) and carries no Python package: the only Python here is
``tools/derive_finger_kinematics.py``, a script.  There is no ``pyproject.toml`` and no entry in
``[tool.uv.workspace].members`` -- deliberately, see the "seven remaining repos" paragraph in CLAUDE.md -- so the root
pytest run collects these files by path, the same arrangement as ``deploy/husky-offboard/tests``.

Both entries are needed because the root run uses ``--import-mode=importlib``: under that mode pytest does NOT prepend
a test file's directory the way the classic ``prepend`` mode does, so neither ``import table_sources`` nor
``import derive_finger_kinematics`` would resolve on its own.  An ``__init__.py`` next to the tests is not the
alternative -- no package in this workspace ships its test tree.

The flip side of that path entry: helper module names are effectively GLOBAL across every test tree in the root run.
``table_sources`` is named for this repo's subject rather than something generic for exactly that reason -- see its
docstring.
