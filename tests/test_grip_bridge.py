"""The driver half of the gripper: it has a self-test, and this is what makes it run in the workspace suite.

``rg6_grip_bridge`` talks XML-RPC to the OnRobot URCap, which exists only on the robot -- so nothing here reaches
the hardware.  What CAN be checked without it is what the node's own ``--selftest`` checks (it spawns a fake URCap
and drives the client against it: units, float coercion, clamping, the timeout, the status message, the linkage
table and the concurrency lock), plus the two properties this package's layout depends on.

The self-test is run as a SUBPROCESS rather than imported: it is the documented invocation, and it is the one the
installer runs before deploying the file.  Importing the module would test a different thing than what is shipped.
