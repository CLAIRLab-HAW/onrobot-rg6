"""The SRDF patch that hooks the RG6 into MoveIt -- and above all its named posture "open".

A ``group_state`` is validated against the joint limits of the model, so the one number the SRDF and the URDF have
to agree on is the open end of the driver joint.  They did not: the patch wrote the geometric zero of the four-bar
chain while ``rg6_v2.yaml`` clamps ``limit.lower`` to the mechanical open stop at 0.038 rad, and MoveIt refused
every plan through the posture with "Goal state is out of bounds!" (measured 2026-08-28 on the a200-0553).  The
tests here tie the patch's value to the config's, in both directions: the default IS the limit, and whatever comes
out lies INSIDE it.
