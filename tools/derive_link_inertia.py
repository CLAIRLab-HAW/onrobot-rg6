"""Derives the ``inertial:`` block of a gripper config from its COLLISION meshes.

Upstream ships one placeholder for every part -- ``mass 0.001`` with ``ixx = iyy = izz = 0.001``.  Both halves are
wrong, and in opposite directions: a 1 g part is three orders of magnitude too light for a hand the data sheet puts at
1,25 kg, while 0,001 kg*m^2 is roughly four orders too HEAVY for a part that fits in 3 cm.  Whatever loads the model
then behaves like a hand made of lead sheet hung on the wrist: MuJoCo and PhysX both read ``<inertial>`` directly, and
``ur_description``'s payload has to carry it.

The way out is not to type better numbers.  It is to compute them from the geometry that is already in the repo:

  1. Each part's volume, centroid and inertia tensor come from its own collision mesh, integrated exactly over the
     closed polyhedron (Eberly, *Polyhedral Mass Properties*) -- not from a bounding box and not from a hull.
  2. ONE density for the whole assembly, fixed so that the sum over all part INSTANCES hits the data sheet mass.
     Homogeneous is wrong in detail (the motor is denser than the flex finger), but it is wrong in a way anyone can
     see and redo, and it distributes the 1,25 kg by volume rather than by taste.
  3. The result is cross-checked against the SECOND data sheet figure, the centre of gravity -- see ``--report``.
     A distribution that hits the mass and misses the CoG by a lot is telling you the homogeneity assumption broke.

Both data sheet figures live in ``contract/robot-contract``'s profile (``gripper.datasheet.mass_kg`` /
``cog_z_m``, OnRobot RG6 operating manual v6.6.2 §8.3.2).  They are handed in here rather than read, so that this
script keeps working in a checkout that has only this repo.
