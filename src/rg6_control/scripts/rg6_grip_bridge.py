"""rg6_grip_bridge: commands the RG6 over XML-RPC to the OnRobot URCap.

Why not over a tool digital output:  the URCap is an RTDE client itself and occupies ``tool_digital_output_mask``.  For
``ur_robot_driver`` to start at all it runs on an input recipe WITHOUT the ``tool_digital_output*`` lines -- so ROS
cannot set a tool DO, and a driver that steers the gripper that way cannot work here.

Why not by URScript over port 30002:  ``rg_grip`` is only defined by the installation preamble that PolyScope puts in
front of every generated program.  A script sent over 30002 runs without that preamble, so the symbol is discarded
(measured: no program change, AI2 unchanged, ``textmsg("literal")`` passes through as a control).

Why onboard and not in the offboard container:  the endpoint hangs off the arm subnet 192.168.131.0/24, and from the
workstation there is no route to it.  And the robot must be able to grip even when the radio link is gone -- the same
argument with which R16 puts the reflex layer onboard.

The endpoint offers more than ``rg_grip``: a complete status path back (``rg_get_width``, ``rg_get_busy``,
``rg_get_grip_detected``, ``rg_get_status``, ``rg_get_safety_failed``).  That makes the voltage approximation over AI2
unnecessary -- and AI2 has turned out to be mis-calibrated by ~17 mm, measured against exactly these getters.

What this node does NOT do:  it does not speak the ``/twin/*`` JSON
protocol.  That is ``plan_server`` in the offboard container, and it does so
identically on ``mock`` and ``real`` -- one code path instead of two.  Here
there are exclusively standard ROS interfaces::

    control_msgs/GripperCommand  (action)   ◀─ MoveIt and plan_server
    sensor_msgs/JointState       (topic)    ─▶ rg6_finger_joint
    std_msgs/String              (topic)    ─▶ rg6/bridge_state, own JSON

So the robot does NOT need ``robot_contract``.  That package is private (not even clonable from the robot), and a
dependency that prevents the deployment is no safeguard.  What is kept are names (ROS parameters) and the linkage
kinematics (a generated table, see FingerKinematics).

    edge-triggered log line.

    WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL -- the topic used to stay silent whenever the gripper did not measure, and that silence
    reaches much further than it looks.  Eight of the ten RG6 links with collision geometry are placed by
    ``robot_state_publisher`` out of ``rg6_finger_joint`` (directly and through the five ``<mimic>`` joints).  Without
    the joint they have NO TF, and ``move_group``'s ``shape_mask`` then cannot mask them out of the depth cloud: the
    whole hand falls out of the octomap self filter and its own fingers become obstacle voxels in front of a camera
    that sits on the gripper.  Measured on the a200-0553 on 2026-09-01 with the arm unpowered: ten ``Missing transform
    for shape mesh`` lines per cloud (handles 14...23, the ten collision meshes of the eight links) and, because the
    updater waits ``shape_transform_cache_lookup_wait_time`` = 0.3 s PER link, an occupancy update every 2.44 s instead
    of the 5 Hz the feed delivers.

    WHY THE LAST MEASURED VALUE FIRST:  the state this guards against is an unpowered tool connector, and an unpowered
    gripper does not move.  The last measurement is therefore the physically correct angle, not a guess -- unlike the
    open stop, which merely is the pose with the largest envelope and thus the conservative one for a clearance check.

    WHY THE OPEN STOP AS THE FALLBACK, and why it is not written as a literal:  ``q_min`` is where the linkage table
    starts, and the table is generated from the URDF (R19).  A hard 0.0 here would be a second place that has to be
    right about the same geometry -- the exact construction model and driver already drifted apart on once.

    What this does NOT do is claim a measurement.  ``status_payload`` is untouched, so the manipulator diagnostics
    still reads ``status: -1``/``safety_failed: true`` and reports the outage; ``state=None`` (the endpoint did not
    answer at all) additionally leaves ``bridge_state`` silent, which is that path's own signal.
