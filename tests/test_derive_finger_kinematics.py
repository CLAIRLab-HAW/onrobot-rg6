"""The generator behind all three copies of the linkage table.

``tools/derive_finger_kinematics.py`` walks the four-bar finger chain out of a GENERATED URDF and samples the joint
angle -> clear width relation.  ``test_linkage_parity.py`` pins down that its three outputs agree with one another --
which they would also do if the generator computed the same wrong thing for all of them.  This is the other half: the
machinery itself.

The real gripper URDF only exists after a xacro run inside the container, so the fixtures here are synthetic chains
whose answer is known by hand.  What that checks is the machinery -- chain walk, pose composition, the joint limit,
the sampling -- not the rg6_v2 geometry, which is the URDF's business and not this script's.
